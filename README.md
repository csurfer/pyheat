Profilers are extremely helpful tools. They help us dig deep into code, find and understand performance bottlenecks. But sometimes we just want to lay back, relax and still get a gist of the hot zones in our code.

> A picture is worth a thousand words.

So, instead of presenting the data in tabular form, if presented as a heatmap visualization, it makes comprehending the time distribution in the given program much easier and quicker. That is exactly what is being done here !

## Features

- Simple CLI interface.
- No complicated setup.
- Heatmap visualization to view hot zones in code.
- Ability to export the heatmap as an image file.
- Ability to scroll, to help view heatmap of large py files.

## Setup

### Using pip

```bash
pip install py-heat
```

### Directly from the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csurfer/pyheat.git
python pyheat/setup.py install
```

## Usage

### As a command

```bash
# To view the heatmap.
pyheat <path_to_python_file>
# To view the heatmap of a script with arguments.
pyheat <path_to_python_file> [arg1 arg2 ...]
# To output the heatmap as a file.
pyheat --out image_file.png <path_to_python_file>
pyheat --help
```

### As a module

```python
from pyheat import PyHeat
# PyHeat initializer takes two arguments: script name and the
# list of command line arguments which can be possibly empty.
ph = PyHeat(<file_path>, [arg1, arg2, ...])
ph.create_heatmap()
# To view the heatmap.
ph.show_heatmap()
# To output the heatmap as a file.
ph.show_heatmap('image_file.png')
```
