Profilers are extremely helpful tools. They help us dig deep into code,
find and understand performance bottlenecks. But sometimes we just want
to lay back, relax and still get a gist of the hot zones in our code.

    A picture is worth a thousand words.

So, instead of presenting the data in tabular form, if presented as a
heatmap visualization, it makes comprehending the time distribution in
the given program much easier and quicker. That is exactly what is being
done here !

Features
--------

* Simple CLI interface.

* No complicated setup.

* Heatmap visualization to view hot zones in code.

* Ability to export the heatmap as an image file.

* Ability to scroll, to help view heatmap of large py files.

Setup
-----

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    pip install py-heat

Directly from the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    git clone https://github.com/csurfer/pyheat.git
    python pyheat/setup.py install

Usage
-----

As a command
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    # To view the heatmap.
    pyheat <path_to_python_file>
    # To view the heatmap of a script with arguments.
    pyheat <path_to_python_file> [arg1 arg2 ...]
    # To output the heatmap as a file.
    pyheat --out image_file.png <path_to_python_file>
    pyheat --help

As a module
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from pyheat import PyHeat
    # PyHeat initializer takes two arguments: script name and the
    # list of command line arguments which can be possibly empty.
    ph = PyHeat(<file_path>, [arg1, arg2, ...])
    ph.create_heatmap()
    # To view the heatmap.
    ph.show_heatmap()
    # To output the heatmap as a file.
    ph.show_heatmap('image_file.png')
